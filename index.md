# Smart Computing for research projects
This is an [MMU Futures](http://www.mmu.ac.uk/students/futures/award.php) workshop that carries 6 bronze points. Please see the [course description](https://www.authorea.com/users/35598/articles/41107/_show_article) on Authorea for an outline of the course content and learning outcomes. The course registration page is [here](http://www.mmu.ac.uk/students/futures/event-detail.php?id=706).

# Schedule

## Day 1

### Introduction
What the course is about and introduction to some useful practices for safe and productive working with computers.

* Motivation
* [Display Screen Equipment safety](#safety)
* [Useful software](#software)  
* [useful services](#services) 
* Open source

### Set up shared documents using several platforms

* google docs - A shared document about filesystem organisation - students invited to add their own suggestions and tricks, and collaboratively build a reference guide based on the content of the course
* Authorea - Everyone add a line to the collaborative story
* GitHub Pages - course content website - Add your project details, as well as any notes, corrections, and resources you want to add. 

We will work together on these documents to:

1. gain experience of the selected collaborative tools
2. produce shared resources that will continue to be useful after the course

Participants will be invited to shared documents by email. We will take some time to register accounts for google and authorea as needed.

### Smart use of files
* naming files
* file types
* using folders
* backup
* metadata
* different versions of the same file
* the cloud
* security

#### Activity:

* Reflect on how you use your files and identify whether you can change your practices
* Begin implementing any change that is practical to work on in the session
* Briefly document this activity to enable you to follow through with it and demonstrate achievement of course objectives
* Contribute findings to the collaborative google docs file.

### Introduction to version control

* [Wikipedia entry on git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) provides a good definition
* [Git Basics Episode 1 What is Version Control?](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control)

*Further reading: other videos on http://git-scm.com*

### Version control for scientific research

Take a look at the resources provided by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html)

* [Best Practices in Scientific Computing](http://swcarpentry.github.io/slideshows/best-practices/index.html) (slideshow and link to paper)
* Example of peatland microbiome research
* Demonstration of using Sourcetree to clone the analysis for the above paper
* Run sourcetree and clone the course website

*Further reading: [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice) (website). Especially note the "Open Science", and "Licensing" sections.*

### Introduction to project
Identify a project you are going to carry out that will benefit from version control and online collaboration. Decide on the best platform to use and if possible identify a partner who can contribute to your project. You can set up the project today or in the next session. Add your project title and description to the course website. Include a link when the project files are set up online, and an explanation of your platform choice.

#### Aside
Whilst all that is going on, we will write a collaborative story using authorea:

* add new line
* commit
* delete previous line
* commit
* email next person)

## Day 2

### Projects
* ensure there is a description and link to your project on the course website, to help others find it and contribute
* Work on your own project
* Contribute to another project - either someone in the class or any other project on the internet

Project work will be broken up with a few short presentations / discussions

* Student talks about their projects (voluntary)
    * How is it going? 
    * Request for collaborators.
* Demonstrators contribute their own experiences
    * Open-source hardware for research
